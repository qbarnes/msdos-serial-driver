This was a serial driver I worked on back in 1987.  The source on
the master branch came from a printout timestamped June 26, 1987.
The code changes on branch "updates" came from handwritten notes on
that original printout.

I have no idea (anymore) where or who created the base code, or
where the driver originally came from.  I'd love to know its history
prior to it coming to our company.
